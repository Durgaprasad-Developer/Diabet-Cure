## Troubleshooting

### 1. Backend Not Starting
- **Issue:** `npm run dev` fails or server does not start.
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure you are in the correct backend folder (`cd Server` or `cd backend`).
  - Check that Node.js version >= 18 is installed.
  - Verify `.env` variables are correctly set (`PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
  - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

### 2. Frontend Not Loading
- **Issue:** `npm start` fails or page is blank.
- **Solution:**
  - Make sure you are in the correct frontend folder (`cd client` or `cd frontend`).
  - Ensure dependencies are installed: `npm install`.
  - Check that the backend server is running, as API calls depend on it.
  - Open browser console for errors and fix missing imports or paths.

### 3. Database Connection Errors
- **Issue:** `MongooseServerSelectionError` or connection refused.
- **Solution:**
  - Verify your `MONGO_URI` in `.env` is correct and accessible.
  - Ensure MongoDB service is running locally, or the cloud instance allows your IP.
  - Check for network/firewall restrictions.

### 4. Authentication Issues
- **Issue:** Login/signup fails or JWT errors occur.
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` matches the one used in backend.
  - Clear browser cache or local storage if tokens are invalid.
  - Verify payload and headers for API requests are correct.

### 5. AI Reports Not Generating
- **Issue:** AI report API returns errors or blank reports.
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env` and has valid access.
  - Check that glucose readings exist for the user; AI needs data to generate insights.
  - Inspect backend logs for API response errors.

### 6. Images Not Loading
- **Issue:** Screenshots or assets not visible on frontend.
- **Solution:**
  - Verify the file paths in your `src/assets` folder.
  - Ensure file names and extensions match exactly (case-sensitive).
  - Rebuild frontend with `npm start` after fixing paths.

### 7. CORS Issues
- **Issue:** Browser blocks requests to the backend.
- **Solution:**
  - Make sure the backend has CORS enabled for frontend origin.
  - Check `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers in server configuration.
